# pyalgotrade-python-3
pyalgotrade working on python 3
PyAlgoTrade is an event driven algorithmic trading Python library. The initial focus was on backtesting, paper trading Bitcoins, shares.  However, the current version can only run under python 2,  thus it cannot enjoy many new features of python 3.   

After debugging the original scripts, I successfully  run them under python 3. 6.

Installation

PyAlgoTrade is developed using Python 3.6 and depends on:
NumPy and SciPy.
pytz.
dateutil.
requests.
matplotlib for plotting support.
ws4py for Bitstamp support.
tornado for Bitstamp support.
tweepy for Twitter support.

This will downgrade the pyalgotrade:
pip install pyalgotrade

clone or download this pyalgotrade-python-3, copy all the files and folds under pyalgotrade-python-3 to override existing pyalgotrade.
